# minecoloniescreatedatapack
Datapack from Shadizar to enable better integration between core Create mod and Minecolonies.


Deliberately excludes items made with mechanical crafting, manual items like andesite casing, for simplicity. This is tested on create-1.19.2-0.5.1.b and later; datapack is untested on prior versions of Create.

I also rearranged some of the colonists (sometimes the auto detection for which colonist would make which recipe were logically a bit off).
Pathblocks are implemented, and ladders/scaffolding should be colonist-usable.
